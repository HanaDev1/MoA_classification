# Mechanism of Action (MoA) 
Mechanism of Action (MoA)of drug prediction using classification algorithms
The term ’mechanism of action’ is a common term utilized for pharmacology when talking about medicines and
drugs. It relates to how the molecular functioning or acts of the drug in the body. Also utilized to describe the more general
reaction or effect of the drug, like what somebody feels when
they take the drug. The mechanism of action is a particular
biological process by which a medication handles the problem
behind it and/or decreases symptoms while a person is taking
medications to cure a disease. The mechanism of a drug is often known and some do not understand the mechanism of action.

This paper intends to predict and classification multiple response
targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) of various samples.
Samples are medications that are profiled at various time points
and doses, using various machine learning algorithms in addition
to compare the accuracy of them.
